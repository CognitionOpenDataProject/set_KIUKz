For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section 3.1. Across participants accuracy. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below:

> A repeated measures two-way ANOVA on accuracy with task and orientation as factors revealed a clear main effect of the task (F(2, 22) = 784.6; p < 0.0005) and of the orientation (F(1, 23) = 402.3; p < 0.0005), as well as a significant interaction between them (F(2, 22) = 60.2; p < 0.0005). Accuracy was smaller in the Familiar Face Recognition condition than in the Individual Face Recognition, which itself was smaller than in the Human Face Categorization (see Fig. 2A). The Familiar Face Recognition was much more difficult than the Individual Face Recognition and Human Face Categorization and not every participant succeeded on the task. In the upright condition, three participants did not succeed on the Familiar Face Recognition and were thus discarded from the study, while in the inverted condition only a few succeeded at this condition (see Table 1). Furthermore, the effect of inversion was computed (i.e. the difference between inverted face accuracy and upright faces accuracy divided by the upright faces accuracy; e.g. Russell, Duchaine, & Nakayama, 2009) and showed a significant difference between the three task (F(2, 22) = 151.4; p < 0.0005).

> Post-hoc analyses showed that this effect was larger in the Familiar Face Recognition than in the Individual Face Recognition (Familiar Face Recognition: 88.1%, SD = 29.6%; Individual Face Recognition: 44.5%, SD = 9.9%; p < 0.0005), which itself was larger than in the Human Face Categorization (8.1%, SD = 10.7%; p < 0.0005; Fig. 2B).
